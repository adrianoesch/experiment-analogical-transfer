\section{Appendix}
\subsection{Material Experiment 1}
\subsubsection{Instructions on CrowdFlower}
In this online experiment, participants will read a few, very short stories. After each story, participants are asked to recall the content of those stories by reconstructing its statements in the order of appearance.
It will take around 20 minutes. There will be a confirmation code handed out at the end. We'll grant you a bonus of 2\$ if we can see that you showed effort. You must be a native English speaker and use a recent version of Chrome, Safari or Firefox to take part in this experiment. Means to facilitate the task are not allowed. You can only take part, if you weren't part of the same experiment already (check here).

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you notice similarities between the stories during the experiment (not now)?
  \item Did you notice repeating elements between the stories during the experiment?
  \item Did you notice any repeating analog/causal structure during the experiment?
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Stories with Relation-Response Options}
After the title of each story, the 3 relations with its placeholders are presented, whereafter the 9 alternative relations per story follow. At first the 7 analog stories are listed, then the 7 filler stories.
