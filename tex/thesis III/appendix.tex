\subsection{Material Experiment 1}
\subsubsection{Instructions on CrowdFlower}
In this online experiment, participants will read a few, very short stories. After each story, participants are asked to recall the content of those stories by reconstructing its statements in the order of appearance.
It will take around 20 minutes. There will be a confirmation code handed out at the end. We'll grant you a bonus of 2\$ if we can see that you showed effort. You must be a native English speaker and use a recent version of Chrome, Safari or Firefox to take part in this experiment. Means to facilitate the task are not allowed. You can only take part, if you weren't part of the same experiment already (check here).
To start the experiment, please open the following link and carefully read the instructions.

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Did you notice similarities between the stories during the experiment (not now)?
  \item Did you notice repeating elements between the stories during the experiment?
  \item Did you notice any repeating analog/causal structure during the experiment?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Material Experiment 2}
\subsubsection{Instructions on CrowdFlower}
In this online experiment, participants will be asked to read very short stories and recall its content after each story. The task is hard, don't expect to remember everything, but put in effort nonetheless. We will probe your attention. It will take around 15 to 20 minutes. There will be a confirmation code handed out at the end, but only if you pay attention to the task. You must be a native English speaker and use a recent version of Chrome, Safari or Firefox to take part in this experiment. We'll hand out a 1\$ bonus if you complete and pay attention. Also you can only take part if you weren't part of another experiment from us (check here).
